# Exercism - Ruby Track

My solutions to each problem in the Ruby Track.

## Running the tests

For running the tests provided, you will need the Minitest gem. Open a
terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:

```
gem install minitest
```

Run the tests from the exercise directory using the following command:

```
ruby <snake-case-exercise>_test.rb
```

Please replace `<snake-case-exercise>` with your exercise name in snake_case.
